You are building a modern incremental / idle web game called “DaoVerse — Infinite Cultivation”.

Goal: Create a fully playable browser game where numbers constantly grow, players unlock new systems over time, and progression feels endless. The theme is Xianxia cultivation.

STACK REQUIREMENTS
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- State: localStorage + in-memory state
- No backend for now (offline playable)
- Modular code, comments, clean structure

GAME FLOW
1. New player signs up (local only)
   - choose username
   - choose gender
   - choose Faction: Demonic / Righteous / Heavenly
   Each faction gives a different starting buff:
   - Demonic: +10% click Qi
   - Righteous: +10% passive Qi
   - Heavenly: -10% Realm costs

2. Main screen shows:
   - Big round button: “Gain Qi”
   - Current Qi
   - Qi per second
   - Current Realm
   - Small notifications panel

3. Clicking “Gain Qi” increases Qi.
Base value = 1 Qi, multiplied by:
   realmMultiplier * itemUpgrades * factionBonus * globalBonuses

PASSIVE GENERATORS
Create purchasable generators that produce Qi automatically.
Examples (editable):

Meditation Mat — cost 10 Qi — +0.5 Qi/sec  
Spirit Well — cost 200 Qi — +3 Qi/sec  
Inner Disciple — cost 5000 Qi — +20 Qi/sec  
Qi Formation — cost 50000 Qi — +120 Qi/sec  

Cost scaling formula:
cost = baseCost * 1.15^level

REALMS (MAJOR PROGRESSION)
Realms multiply all gains, but reset Qi upon breakthrough:

Body Tempering — x2  
Qi Condensation — x3  
Foundation — x5  
Core Formation — x10  
Nascent Soul — x20  
Sage — x35  
Immortal — x50  

Player must reach a Qi threshold for each realm. When breaking through, show animation and reset current Qi but keep multipliers.

ACHIEVEMENTS
Add visible & hidden achievements that permanently boost stats
(ex: first 1,000 Qi, first 10 upgrades, first breakthrough, etc).

RESEARCH TREE
Add a research screen with upgrades such as:
- Qi Efficiency: multiplies all gains
- Realm Insight: reduces breakthrough costs
- Automation unlocks
Research should take time, not only Qi, and feel long-term.

PRESTIGE SYSTEM (ASCENSION)
Add an Ascension mechanic when players become very strong. Ascension resets MOST progress but awards “Ascension Points”.

Formula suggestion:
Ascension Points = floor(log10(totalQiEver)) - 4

Ascension Points can be spent on:
- Global Qi multiplier
- Faster generators
- Offline gains
- Unique permanent perks

DESIGN RULES
- No hard caps: progression should feel infinite.
- Avoid dead zones (always give something to work toward).
- Introduce systems gradually so beginners aren’t overwhelmed.
- Show satisfying number formatting (K, M, B, T, Qa, Qi, etc).

UI REQUIREMENTS
- Clean minimalist style
- Big clickable button for Qi
- Panels for:
  - Generators
  - Realms
  - Research
  - Achievements
  - Ascension (later)
Use animations that feel smooth but not flashy.

SAVE SYSTEM
- Auto-save every 3 seconds to localStorage.
- Add “Export Save” and “Import Save” buttons.

DELIVERABLE
Generate:
- Full React project structure
- Implement all core systems described above
- Include comments explaining key formulas
- Provide instructions on how to run locally with npm

Focus first on: click system + generators + realms.
Then layer achievements, research, and prestige.
Make it easy to extend later.

If anything is unclear, assume the simplest reasonable solution and proceed.
